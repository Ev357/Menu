# Menu
Menu is a Wear OS app for seeing, ordering school cafeteria food using iCanteen by [Z-WARE](https://www.z-ware.cz/)

## Features
- Seeing food, including allergens and order timing
- Ordering food (if logged in)
- Also works offline
- Custom server (defaults to `https://jidelnicek.roznovskastredni.cz`)
- Custom food preferences

## Installation
1. Download the APK from the latest [release](https://github.com/Ev357/Menu/releases).
2. Install an app that allows sideloading the APK to your watch. I recommend using [GeminiMan WearOS Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geminiman.wearosmanager).
3. I reccomend following the guide provided by the developer itself. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNANot-4PPU).
4. Connect the app to your watch, then select the APK file you downloaded earlier and click "INSTALL APK FILE".

_There are sure other ways to do so, but i think this one is the most user friendly. Also the app is dope XD._

## Notes
- Regarding the functionality that's been logged: I've made efforts to secure it, but please be aware that this is my first Kotlin project. While I've tried to ensure security, I can't guarantee it's completely foolproof. Please proceed at your own discretion. However, based on my understanding, it should be satisfactory.
- As mentioned earlier, this is my inaugural project, and I acknowledge that the code isn't optimal. I'm open to suggestions for improvement or learning opportunities.
- Additionally, while logged in, I recommend waiting for everything to to load before doing any orders. There might be some bugs, especially on devices with low performance or slow network speeds, although it should generally function without issue.
